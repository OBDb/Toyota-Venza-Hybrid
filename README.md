## About Toyota Venza Hybrid

## Generations

- **First Generation (2009-2015)**: The first-generation Venza was introduced as a mid-size crossover SUV with both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations. While this generation was available with a hybrid drivetrain in some markets, it primarily featured conventional gasoline engines in most regions: a 2.7L inline-four producing 182 hp and a 3.5L V6 producing 268 hp. The original Venza was designed with a focus on blending the comfort of a sedan with the utility of an SUV, featuring a spacious interior and car-like handling.

- **Second Generation (2021-present)**: After a hiatus, Toyota reintroduced the Venza exclusively as a hybrid vehicle. This generation is built on Toyota's TNGA-K platform and is powered by a 2.5L four-cylinder engine combined with three electric motors, producing a total system output of 219 hp. All models come standard with electronic on-demand all-wheel drive. The second-generation Venza features a sleeker, more upscale design with premium interior materials and advanced technology features, including an available Star Gaze panoramic roof that can switch between transparent and frosted modes.
